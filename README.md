# skillsparser for myitjob

Searching for skills in a job description.

Admin Panel: Convert text (from job description) into an array. Compare this array with another array (skill list) and find duplicates.
Set the duplicates as skills.

In this way I don't have to set the skills on the jobs manually anymore. The function would compare the text with the array of skills and would show all the skills it found and add it to the job.
